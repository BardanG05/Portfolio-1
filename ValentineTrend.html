            This was a trend on Tiktok, where people would code cute valentines themed projects to share with their friends and loved ones.
            I decided to join in on the fun and create my own project with alot of inspiration from others, and my own twists.

            I have removed most the texts and replaced with placeholders, as I am no longer with the person so it would be weird, but you can see and guess where what things would've been.

        <h2>
            Context - Tiktok Trend
        </h2>
        <p>
            In early 2024, just a couple weeks before Valentines Day, a trend started on Tiktok where people would create valentines themed coding projects to ask their significant other for valentines.
            This as I remember blew up on Tiktok, with thousands of people loving the idea and so many non-coders also appreciating the projects. Most projects were similar to each other
            so mine isn't very different either but I went a step further by adding my own teist at the end to make it somewha original and cute.
        <p>

        <h2>
            About the Project
        </h2>
        <p>
            The project consists of HTML CSS and alot of Javascript. I used JS for the alerts, the movement of the button, queing of the animations for the song and any other little tweaks that make the whole thing look much smoother.
            Overall it was a very fun and challenging project to make, and I am happy with the final result.
        <p>
