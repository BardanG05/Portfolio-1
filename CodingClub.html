            Overview
        </h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            This was the final project in the "Coding Club" I used to run with my friend back in sixth form.
            The project was a near 1-to-1 replica of the instagram webpage, using HTML and CSS only.
        <p>

        <p style="margin-top: 0;">
            The instagram webpage has been chnaged since so it does not replicate the current version, but it is how it used to look.

            Context - Coding Club
        </h2>
        <p>
            Coding Club was a school club me and my friend created at the start of Year 13. We were both passionate about coding and wanted to share our knowledge with other students.
            The club met once a week after school, and we would teach different programming languages and concepts to those who showed up. I taught HTML and CSS, while my friend focused on Python.
            We had people ranging from year 7s all the way to year 12s in the club, with all differnt skill and experience levels. It was a great experience for me, as I got to teach and connect with other coders around school.

        <h2>
            Insight - Final Project
        </h2>
        <p>
            After teaching most of the HTML and CSS, I decided to set them a final task, where they would need to apply everything they learned 
            over the course of the year/club to create a near replica of the Instagram webpage. This would test their knowledge and skills, as well as give them a fun project to work on.
            I made a  sample version of the project myself, to show them what they should aim for and to provide a reference point.
